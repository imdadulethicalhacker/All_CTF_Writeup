## Question
#### Hmmm I wonder if you have learned your lesson... Let's see if you understand RSA and how the encryption works. Connect with nc mercury.picoctf.net 4484.
### Hint
>#### 1. Look at the ciphertext, anything fishy, maybe a little bit long?
>#### 2. What happens if you encrypt the same input multiple times?
>#### 3. Is RSA deterministic, why would outputs vary?
