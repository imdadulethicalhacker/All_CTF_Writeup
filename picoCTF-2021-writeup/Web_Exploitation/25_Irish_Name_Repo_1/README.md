## Question
#### There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/ [link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:39720. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
### Hint
>#### 1. There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
>#### 2. Try to think about how the website verifies your login.
