## Question
#### This website looks familiar... Log in as admin Site: http://mercury.picoctf.net:65261/ Filter: http://mercury.picoctf.net:65261/filter.php
### Hint
>#### 1. I tried to make it a little bit less contrived since the mini competition.
>#### 2. Each filter is separated by a space. Spaces are not filtered.
>#### 3. There is only 1 round this time, when you beat it the flag will be in filter.php.
>#### 4. There is a length component now.
>#### 5. sqlite
